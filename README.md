For a scalable microservices-based application handling user creation, account creation, transactions, and balance updates, here’s a high-level architecture:
1. Microservices Overview

   User Service – Manages user creation and authentication.

   Account Service – Handles account creation, linking to users.

   Transaction Service – Processes transactions between accounts.

   Balance Service – Maintains real-time account balances.

2. Architecture Design
   Microservices & Responsibilities
   Microservice	Responsibilities
   User Service	- Create and manage users
- Handle authentication (JWT, OAuth2)
- Maintain user profile data
  Account Service	- Create and manage bank accounts
- Link accounts to users
  Transaction Service	- Execute transactions (debit/credit)
- Validate transactions (e.g., sufficient balance, fraud detection)
  Balance Service	- Maintain real-time account balances
- Handle balance updates asynchronously (via event-driven updates)
3. Tech Stack

   Java + Spring Boot (for microservices)

   Spring Cloud (for service discovery, configuration, resilience)

   Kafka/RabbitMQ (for event-driven communication)

   PostgreSQL/MySQL (for relational data storage)

   Redis (for caching user sessions, balance updates)

   Kubernetes (K8s) + Docker (for containerization and scaling)

   API Gateway (Spring Cloud Gateway / Kong) (for managing external API calls)

   OAuth2 / Keycloak (for authentication & authorization)

4. Communication Pattern

   Synchronous (REST/gRPC):

        User Service <-> Account Service (e.g., Fetching user details)

   Asynchronous (Kafka/RabbitMQ):

        Transaction Service → Balance Service (Balance updates)

        Account Service → User Service (User-account linking)

5. Database & Storage

   User & Account Service → PostgreSQL (normalized data)

   Transaction Service → Event Sourcing with Kafka + PostgreSQL

   Balance Service → Redis (for fast reads) + PostgreSQL (for persistence)

6. Security & Scalability

   Rate Limiting & Load Balancing → API Gateway

   Service Discovery → Spring Cloud Eureka / Kubernetes Service Mesh

   Fault Tolerance → Circuit Breakers (Resilience4J)

   Observability → Prometheus + Grafana (monitoring), ELK stack (logging)

   Scalability → Auto-scaling with Kubernetes
